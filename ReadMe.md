# LaTeX Report Template
## Robert Haines

### Summary

A LaTeX report template with all the boilerplate I need to get a new document started quickly.

### Usage

Download [report.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hainesr/report_template/master/report.tex), rename as required, edit, build.

### Notes and macros

#### Abstract name

If you want to use a different name for the abstract section, such as 'Executive summary', use the following template:

```latex
\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Executive summary}
```

#### `\cpp`

Renders C++ nicely. Using this macro looks much better than just typing C++ into your document.

#### `\notetoself`

Renders text in red and uppercase for use as a mnemonic within a document.
